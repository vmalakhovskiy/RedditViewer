# Hi!

My name is Reddie, and I'm here to enlight top Reddit news for you!

- I can show you a picture for Reddits that have them; you can find it by little magnifying glass near the thumbnail. But not in .gif format, it's my worst enemy.
- I'm supporting pagination, so only 50 Reddits will be grabbed at once.
- I can cache images
- I can preserve and restore showing news for you.
- I can save full-size pictures into gallery
- I'm in friendship with landscape mode
- I'm not using any 3-rd party libraries
- I have ~69% tests coverage
- I'm written purely on Swift 3

Here some screenshots:
